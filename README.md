  # FROM CHAOS TO CLARITY: CLEANING UP SALES DATA LIKE A PRO!


Ever opened a dataset and felt like you just walked into a messy storehouse, with numbers and missing values scattered everywhere? 
Well, thatâ€™s exactly what happened when we got our hands on this raw sales data. 
But donâ€™t worryâ€”just like a skilled store manager, weâ€™ve tidied things up, and weâ€™re here to tell you how!


# Step 1: Importing the Data
First things first, we imported the raw sales data into Excel as a CSV file. 
This file contained valuable information, but it was like finding gold in a pile of sandâ€”there were missing values, inconsistencies, 
and formatting issues that needed some serious attention.


# Step 2: Cleaning Using Power Query
Think of Power Query as your magical broomâ€”it sweeps through the data, fixing problems while you sip your coffee. Hereâ€™s what we did:
ïƒ¼	Handled Missing Values: Some entries had empty fields (like amounts or locations). We either filled them in with relevant data or removed them if necessary.
ïƒ¼	Standardized Formats: Dates, product names, and categories were inconsistent, so we ensured they followed a uniform format.
ïƒ¼	Removed Duplicates: We got rid of redundant entries because nobody likes seeing the same record multiple times (unless itâ€™s about money coming in!).

# Step 3: Exporting Back to Excel
Once the cleaning was done, we exported the polished data back to Excelâ€”now neat, structured, and ready for action! 
No more mess, no more headachesâ€”just clean, reliable information at our fingertips.

# Whatâ€™s Next? Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)!
With our cleaned dataset in place, it's time for the fun partâ€”Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Weâ€™ll be diving into insights, trends, and patterns to make smarter business decisions. 
Stay tuned for the next video, where we uncover the real story behind these numbers!
Until then, remember: Clean data = Smarter decisions = Bigger profits! ðŸš€
